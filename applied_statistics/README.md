A. What is the percentage of students who score more than 80.
B. What is the percentage of students who score less than 50.
C. What should be the distinction mark if the highest 10% of students are to be awarded distinction?
### Question 6
Explain 1 real life industry scenario [other than the ones mentioned above] where you can use the concepts learnt in this module of Applied statistics to get a data driven business solution.
